# IHVolunteeringAPI
RESTFul API to serve data to and from the IH Volunteering applications

## Running locally
From the `IHVolunteerAPI` directory of the project, run the following:

```bash
dotnet run
```

This should spin up the server locally, accessible on `https://localhost:5008`.

## Postgres

You need to have an instance of postgres running on port 5432 for the API to communicate with.
